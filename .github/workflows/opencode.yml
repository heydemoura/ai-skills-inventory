            - Create or modify skill folders under `skills/`
            - Each skill must have a `SKILL.md` with proper YAML frontmatter (name, description, metadata)
            - Include `scripts/` and/or `references/` subdirectories as needed
            - Follow the patterns of existing skills in this repo

            When done, create a PR with all changes. Reference the issue number in the PR description.
